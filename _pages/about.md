This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
I am an applied  researcher in Artificial Intelligence with over 15 years of experience working mainly  on EdTech, urban  computing, smart cities and  Big Data for Social Good. I strongly believe that Big Data/AI is the next frontier for innovation and will change the way societies operate from an expert-base approach to a data-driven approach. Apart from research in Big Data I am also very interested in technology transfer and IPR, as the main means of producing a social impact from research results. 

Currently I work as a Senior Researcher at UNIR-iTED (Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education). Before that I worked at Telefonica Research for 13 years, for the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 2006 to 2008,  for the Department of Information Systems & Computing of Brunel University in London from 2003 to 2006 , and for the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University from 2001 to 2003.

I have received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2000, and a Ph.D. degree in Information Systems from Brunel University, London, U.K., in 2007. I was the recipient of the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award of the School of Computer Science 2001, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
