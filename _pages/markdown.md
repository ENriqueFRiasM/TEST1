 * [MathJax Documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)

## MathJax 

Support for MathJax Version 3.0 is included in the template:

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$

The default delimiters of `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` are supported for displayed mathematics, while `\\(...\\)` should be used for in-line mathematics (ex., \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\))

**Note** that since Academic Pages uses Markdown which cases some interference with MathJax and LaTeX for escaping characters and new lines, although [some workarounds exist](https://math.codidact.com/posts/278763/278772#answer-278772).

## Markdown guide

Academic Pages uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for Markdown rendering, which has some differences from other Markdown implementations such as GitHub's. In addition to this guide, please see the [kramdown Syntax page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for full documentation.

Basic notices or call-outs are supported using the following syntax:

```markdown
**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

You can also write larger blocks of code with syntax highlighting supported for some languages, such as Python:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

or R:

```R
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)
```

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
