I am an applied  researcher in Artificial Intelligence with over 15 years of experience working mainly  on EdTech, urban  computing, smart cities and  Big Data for Social Good. I strongly believe that Big Data/AI is the next frontier for innovation and will change the way societies operate from an expert-base approach to a data-driven approach. Apart from research in Big Data I am also very interested in technology transfer and IPR, as the main means of producing a social impact from research results. 

Currently I work as a Senior Researcher at UNIR-iTED (Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education). Before that I worked at Telefonica Research for 13 years, for the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 2006 to 2008,  for the Department of Information Systems & Computing of Brunel University in London from 2003 to 2006 , and for the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University from 2001 to 2003.

I have received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2000, and a Ph.D. degree in Information Systems from Brunel University, London, U.K., in 2007. I was the recipient of the Best Ph.D. Thesis Award of the School of Computer Science 2001, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.
